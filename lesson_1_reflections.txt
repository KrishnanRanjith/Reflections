This is the first time i'm using Gitbash .Really it was a good 
experience to findout the difference between two files with the help of 
command like FC.

This is the first update of the file ,intent to keep track of the differences between different versions

Now,this time the update is about the pros and cons of manual commiting
and automatic commiting

Since you're the developer ,potentially you know when to make a commit.
sometimes you think the changes you are made are small and not enough to make commit which may be differ for others.
